# Deep_Learning_Project1
I partnered up with four people from my Deep Learning course.
The aim of Project #1 is to perform explanatory data analysis (EDA) on wine class classification using the classical method in addition to implementing TensorFlow data validation.
We then develop a multi-classification deep learning model to provide reliable predictions that correctly classify the origin of wine.
Lastly, we performed hyperparameter tuning to choose parameters that improve the performance of the model and generalize new unseen data.
